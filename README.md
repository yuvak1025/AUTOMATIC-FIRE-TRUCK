Autonomous Firefighting System
This project focuses on developing an autonomous fire engine capable of detecting and extinguishing fires within its range. The system can be controlled remotely via a mobile app, utilizing open-source hardware such as the Arduino platform.

Project Overview
The autonomous fire engine operates in three primary phases:

Remote Control: The vehicle can be remotely driven using a Bluetooth module connected to the Arduino. Instructions for moving forward, backward, right, and left are transmitted from the mobile app to the vehicle, which then responds accordingly.
Fire Detection: The vehicle is equipped with flame sensors to detect the direction of the fire. Upon detecting a fire, the vehicle autonomously moves towards it.
Fire Suppression: A motor pump is utilized to spray water over the fire, effectively extinguishing it.
Accomplishments
This semester, we achieved the following milestones:

Developed a novel concept: "Voice-controlled Fire Detection Truck" using MIT app developer.
Optimized the vehicle's code using the Arduino IDE.
Procured all necessary parts from online sources.
Software Used
Arduino IDE: Programming the vehicle.
MIT app developer: Creating the mobile app for remote control.
Machine Status
Automatic firefighting systems, particularly autonomous fire suppression vehicles, are still in the research and development stages in India.
Several companies worldwide are conducting trials on automatic fire trucks to enhance firefighting efficiency, including Ezitracker (Australia), BionicHIVE (Singapore), and Robotise (Belgium).
